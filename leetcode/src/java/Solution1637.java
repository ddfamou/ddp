    Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.

    A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

    Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.



    Example 1:

    â€‹
    Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.
    Example 2:

    Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
    Output: 3


    Constraints:

    n == points.length
    2 <= n <= 105
    points[i].length == 2
    0 <= xi, yi <= 109*/
public class Solution1637 {
    public int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(int[][] points) {
        int[] l = new int[points.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++){
            l[i] = points[i][0];
        }
        int[] s = Arrays.stream(l).sorted().toArray();
        int res = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {
            res = Math.max(res, s[i + 1] - s[i]);
        }
        return res;

    }
